    - String manipulations such as reverse of numbers, counting of vowels in a string, replacing of words.
    
    - Creating list of numbers and print each using a loop ad finding the minimum and maximum of numbers in a list. 

    - dictionary and functions 

# Git and Github

For the github task, ive been able to
    - add python files to git repositoryand make commits after adding the files.

    - create new branch and adding each section to the branch, as well as practice switching between the branches.

    - push my code to a new git hub repository and add a readme file to describe my project.
    
    - create a pull request for code review after inviting my tutor to my github repository.
